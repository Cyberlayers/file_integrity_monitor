# File Integrity Monitor (FIM)

The **File Integrity Monitor (FIM)** is a Python-based tool designed to detect unauthorised changes to files and directories in real time. It logs file additions, modifications, and deletions, ensuring data integrity and enhancing security. This tool is ideal for system administrators and security professionals seeking to monitor critical files.

## Features
- Tracks changes in specified directories.
- Detects:
  - **New files** added.
  - **File modifications**.
  - **File deletions**.
- Logs events in real time.
- Persistent state management:
  - Uses a JSON file to store file hashes, enabling detection across script restarts.
- Lightweight and easy to configure.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Cyberlayers/file_integrity_monitor.git
   cd file_integrity_monitor
2. Ensure Python is installed:
   sudo apt update

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the tool
python3 file_integrity_monitor.py
2. Add a file:
  echo "New test file" > /home/kali/test_directory/new_file.txt
3. Modify a file
   echo "Modified content" >> /home/kali/test_directory/new_file.txt
4. Delete a file
   rm /home/kali/test_directory/new_file.txt
5. Observe the output for real-time logging of changes.
